# Assignment: Debugging a Simple Program
### Objective:
- Review a codebase hosted on GitHub, identify its functionality, and spot potential issues.
- Clone the repository to a local environment, debug the identified issue(s).
- Push the fixed code back to the repository through a Pull Request (PR).

### GitHub Repository:

**Repository Name**: Simple Code Calculator

**URL**: https://github.com/exampleuser/simple-code-calculator

### Task Steps:

1. **Reviewing the Code:**

- Clone the repository to your local environment.
- Examine the code files provided in the repository.
- Understand their functionality and logic.

2. **Identify the Issue:**

- Review the code thoroughly to identify any potential issues, bugs, or improvements.
- Pay close attention to mathematical operations, input validations, and error handling.

3. **Debugging:**

- If you identify any issues, debug the code to fix them.
- Ensure that the script functions correctly according to its intended purpose.

4. **Testing:**

- Test the script with various inputs to validate its correctness.
- Ensure that it handles edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.

5. **Pushing Fixes:**

- Once you have fixed the issue(s), commit your changes locally.
- Push your changes back to the repository on GitHub.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description of the changes made.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Push your fixed code to a new branch in the same repository.
- Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main branch.
- Ensure that your PR includes a clear description of the problem identified and the solution implemented.
- Notify the hiring team once you have submitted your PR.

### Additional Notes:

- You are encouraged to document your thought process and any assumptions made during the debugging process.
- Feel free to utilize any debugging tools or resources at your disposal.
- Demonstrate your problem-solving skills and ability to work with existing codebases.

**Languages Available**: The candidate is free to choose any programming language of their preference from the top 10 most popular ones (e.g., Python, TypeScript, Java, PHP, C++, C#, TypeScript, Swift, Ruby, Go, etc.).
